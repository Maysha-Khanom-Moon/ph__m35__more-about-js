## Promise
- the promise object represents the completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. There are 3 states:
    - 1. Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
    - 2. resolve: the operation was completed successfully
    - 3. reject: the operation failed
